Notification-Bar Project
This project is made by me using HTML,CSS , Javascript and JQuery
This Project features behaviour in the notification page -
1)If we click on any unread message , it turns to being read.
2)Messages have been distinguished as read and unread with a red dot and background color.
3)If we click Mark as Read, then all messages turn Read and color and circle appearance changes accordingly.
This Notification Page has a simplicit design with behavioural packed features which make its UI/UX compatible with many devices.
